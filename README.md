SwingingMonkeyCommander is a Jython tool that, by using monkeyrunner, interacts with an Android device by sending input events and displaying the screen by pulling screenshots. 

The tool was developed as an effort to be able to work with devices where the touch screen input was broken at some level.

To run it, pass it as a parameter to the monkeyrunner tool located in the Android SDK.
